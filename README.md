## Brief for Crypto Tracker

A local trader has come to you with a portfolio of cryptos. She wants to be able to analyse it more effectively. She has a small sample data set to give you and would like you to build a Minimum Viable Product that uses the data to display her portfolio so that she can make better decisions.

## How to get the app running

### Inital set-up

- Once you have cloned the files onto your device run the following commands in server: `npm install npm run seeds`
- Then inside the client directory, run this command: `npm install`

### Running the app

- First start up mongod with the command `mongod` in the terminal
- Then make a new tab, make your way into server and run this command: `npm run server:dev`
- Finally, open another termnial tab and from the client directory run: `npm start`

Your browser should open and direct you to the main page of the app!
